DENISE SH

2D time-domain isotropic (visco)elastic finite-difference modeling and full waveform inversion (FWI) code for SH-waves, which I developed together with Denise De Nil and Eva Dokter.

A manual for the SH code is not available, but most features are similar to the P-SV code DENISE Black-Edition, for which a manual is available at:
